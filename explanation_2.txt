# Time Complexity
    The time complexity of rotated_array_search is entirely dependent on the time complexity of the
    rotated_binary_search recursive function which has a time complexity of O(log(n)) since it mimicks the
    binary search with some tweaking

# Space Complexity
    The space complexity of the solution is O(1)
